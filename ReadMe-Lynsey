I had a few different ideas for the 3 artworks so I’ve attempted a few different designs.

Valued.pde
The first file Valued.pde is quite a simple change in that I just changed the words used to make up the Ascii word.
The feeling valued artwork is the one I used for this solution. I changed them to make hidden heart shapes as I think 
when we are valued it makes us feel believed in <3

Solution.pde
The second solution I attempted was to hide the word ‘SOLUTION’ within the ascii work for the challenged artwork.
My idea behind this one was that although we may be challenged there is often a simple solution hiding that we as engineers have 
to find. I had attempted to add brightness to this word so when you hovered over the Challenged word the Solution word would get 
brighter almost as if a torch was shining on it. I ran into a few roadblocks with this one and couldn’t get it completed in time. 

Lightbulb.pde
The third idea I had which also is for the challenged artwork was to add my own Ascii artwork in the form of a lightbulb. 
Because when we are challenged we get those eureka lightbulb moments when a solution hits us!
